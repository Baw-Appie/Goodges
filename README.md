# Goodges
Goodbye badges, hello labels!

### Description
Goodges radically changes the way notifications are displayed on the homescreen.

It replaces the badges by changing the icon labels. For instance, if there is a notification pending on the Facebook app, the label of the application is changed to '1 notification'.
But Goodges is intelligent ! It varies depending on the app : if there are two updates pending on Cydia, the label will display '2 updates'.
Also, if the app is set so as to not display any badges, Goodges will take that into account and will not show anything.
